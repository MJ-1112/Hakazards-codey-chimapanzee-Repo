❓ Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)
1. What is this platform about?
We’ve built a blockchain-based gaming platform that integrates Web3 features like NFTs, token rewards, and decentralized gameplay. Our goal is to let players truly own their in-game assets and enjoy a next-gen gaming experience.

2. What blockchain does this project use?
Our platform is built on the Monad Testnet, a high-performance blockchain designed for scalable and efficient smart contract execution.

3. Do I need a crypto wallet to play?
Yes. Since our platform is Web3-integrated, you’ll need a wallet (like MetaMask or a Monad-compatible wallet) to interact with the games, store NFTs, and receive rewards.

4. Is it free to play?
Absolutely! Most features are free on the testnet. You can explore the platform, try out the games, and test Web3 functionalities without spending real money.

5. What kind of games are on the platform?
Currently, we’re focusing on blockchain-based mini-games with NFT integration and token rewards. We're constantly building and experimenting, so expect new content regularly!

6. What is the Monad Testnet?
Monad is a high-speed, scalable blockchain that supports smart contracts. We’re using its testnet for development and experimentation, which means all activity is gas-free and risk-free for users right now.

7. Can I earn real money from the platform?
Since this is on a testnet, rewards don’t have real-world value yet. However, the structure is designed to easily shift into a mainnet setup in the future, where real earning potential exists.

8. Is this project open-source or still in development?
The platform is still in active development—designed and maintained by a team of four college students. We’re learning, building, and improving every day!
